# Anime Character Identifier App

An iOS application that helps users identify anime characters by taking photos. Using advanced AI technology including Meta's SAM2 for segmentation and Llama3 for character recognition, the app provides quick and accurate identification of anime characters along with their series information.

## Features

- üì∏ Take photos or select from photo library
- üéØ Precise character segmentation using SAM2
- üîç Accurate character identification powered by Llama3
- üì± Clean and intuitive iOS interface

## How It Works

1. **Capture**: Take a photo of an anime character you want to identify
2. **Process**: SAM2 segments the character from the background
3. **Identify**: Llama3 analyzes the image using our Anime Characters Database (ACDB)
4. **Result**: Get character name, anime series, and related information
